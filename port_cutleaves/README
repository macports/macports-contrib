Inspired by FreeBSD's pkg_cutleaves, port_cutleaves is an interactive script
that eases the uninstallation of leaves - installed ports that are unrequested
and have no dependents.

An example run is as follows:

[Leaf 1 of 2] mercurial @1.1.2_0+bash_completion (Active):
  [keep] / (u)ninstall / (f)lush / (a)bort: u
** mercurial @1.1.2_0+bash_completion will be uninstalled.

[Leaf 2 of 2] subversion @1.5.5_0+bash_completion+tools+unicode_path (Active):
  [keep] / (u)ninstall / (f)lush / (a)bort:
** subversion @1.5.5_0+bash_completion+tools+unicode_path will be kept.

--->  Deactivating mercurial @1.1.2_0+bash_completion
--->  Uninstalling mercurial @1.1.2_0+bash_completion

The following ports were uninstalled:
  mercurial @1.1.2_0+bash_completion
